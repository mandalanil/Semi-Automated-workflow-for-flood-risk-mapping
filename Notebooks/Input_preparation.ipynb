    "### Section 1.1 – Dataset Clipping and Folder Management Based on HUC Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script automates raster clipping and folder organization based on HUC boundaries. It is designed to streamline the setup of input datasets for the flood risk modeling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📁 Required Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend preparing all datasets listed in FAU (2020), including:\n",
    "- Digital Elevation Model (DEM)\n",
    "- Water Table Elevation\n",
    "- Water Holding Capacity\n",
    "- Impervious Mask\n",
    "- Water Mask\n",
    "- Design Rainfall Rasters\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain consistency and ensure smooth processing, keep variable names consistent with the naming convention used in the script. If you use custom names, you may need to manually modify the replacement logic in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ 1. Set the Project Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the `project_dir` variable to the root folder that contains your geodatabase, raster datasets, and where output subdirectories will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "project_dir = r\"X:\\path\\to\\your\\project\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🗂 2. Configure HUC Boundary Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "In the script, configure the following parameters based on your geodatabase:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gdb_name = \"Homestead\"         # Name of your geodatabase (without '.gdb')\n",
    "huc_fname = \"HUC_Boundaries\"   # Name of the HUC boundary feature class\n",
    "huc_col = \"HUC_NAME\"           # Column name for HUC boundary names\n",
    "id_col = \"HUC_ID\"              # Column name for unique HUC identifiers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 3. Define Dataset Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "The script uses a `datasets` dictionary to locate and organize raster inputs. Update it with the paths to your datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "datasets = {\n",
    "    \"dem_ft\": r\"path\\to\\DEM.tif\",\n",
    "    \"wte_ft\": r\"path\\to\\WaterTable.tif\",\n",
    "    \"whc_ratio\": r\"path\\to\\WHC.tif\",\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use descriptive keys that match the naming convention to simplify downstream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ▶️ 4. Run the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure ArcGIS Pro and the Python environment are properly installed.\n",
    "- Confirm you have read/write permissions in the specified directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed:\n",
    "- If your HUC feature class contains **multiple rows**, the script will:\n",
    "  - Create a subdirectory under `HUC12s/` for each HUC.\n",
    "  - Clip each raster to its respective HUC extent.\n",
    "- If the HUC feature class contains **only one row**, clipped datasets will be saved to the `basedir/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🗃 5. Mosaic Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "After clipping is completed:\n",
    "- The script groups the resulting raster files by name and extension.\n",
    "- Mosaics are generated for each group and saved in the `mosaic/` directory under `project_dir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the `mosaic/` directory exists, or the script is set to create it before saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Final Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain consistent naming for all rasters.\n",
    "- Check spatial reference and alignment across input datasets.\n",
    "- This script is an essential first step in preparing your data for flood scenario modeling and risk assessment.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ensure the `project_dir` variable is correctly set to your working project path. This should point to the folder that contains your clipped input rasters.\n",
